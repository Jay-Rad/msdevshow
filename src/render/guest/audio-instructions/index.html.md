We want you to sound as amazing as possible. Recording your own audio track will **significantly** increase the audio quality of your episode. It takes only seconds to set up with a free tool called Audacity.

(we also have backups on our end, so no need to stress)

### Before/During the Show

1. [Download Audacity from here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/files/latest/download). Don't worry, it's free and a small (24mb) download.
1. In Audacity, select your microphone, switch to mono, and press the record button.

### FAQ

* **What if I'm unsure which microphone is correct?** Do a test recording before the show, and tap on the mic you're using. Listen to the recording. Be sure to discard that track before recording for the show
